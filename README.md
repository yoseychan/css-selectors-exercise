##__An exercise for the advanced CSS selectors.__

###You are supposed to do the following styling to the given HTML code in CSS:
- Every even list item should have text color of green;
- The third list item should have a background color of light blue;
- The first list item should have a top border, 1px in width, solid and green;
- The last list item should have a bottom border 5px in width, dotted and blue;
- Third and fifth list items' anchor should be colored in red;
- Fifth list items' anchor should turn gray when hovered on;
- Second and fifth list item should lose the bullet points;
- All regular text type input fields should have a gray background when focused on;
- The first name input field should have green text color when focused on;
- The last name input field should have blue text color when focused on;
- Password type input field should have invisible text when typed in;
- When a selection is made inside the email type input field, the selection background should turn yellow and the text color purple;
- Submit type input should have red text color when hovered on.

**You are not allowed to change the HTML, therefore not allowed to use any classes and ids.**

You should use the advanced CSS selectors we have learned on the class.
